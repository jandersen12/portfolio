## Comfort with Data Sharing on Online News Websites: A Cross-Regional Perspective

### Overview

This directory contains the final presentation and report for an experimental research design project focused on exploring and analyzing users' comfort with data sharing on online news websites across different regions. While there is not a code component to this project, there is an importance to conducting rigorous background research and designing well-structured experiments to support succesful data collection, cleaning and analysis when implemented. Thoughtful experiment planning will help ensure that the data collected is meaningful and representative of well thought-out definitions, that bias minimization has been considered, and that there is a clear purpose for the collection of new data.  

### Project Purpose
As online news platforms increasingly rely on user data for personalization and advertising, it is important to understand how transparency and control over personal information impact user trust and willingness to share data. This study investigates how variations in privacy settings influence users’ comfort in sharing their information and examines the role of geographic, cultural, and technological literacy factors in shaping these attitudes.
