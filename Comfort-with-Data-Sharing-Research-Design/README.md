## Comfort with Data Sharing on Online News Websites: A Cross-Regional Perspective

### Overview

This project presents a conceptual experimental research design project focused on exploring and analyzing users' comfort with data sharing on online news websites across different regions. While there is not a code component to this project, there is an importance to conducting rigorous background research and designing well-structured experiments to support succesful data collection, cleaning and analysis when implemented. Thoughtful experiment planning will help ensure that the data collected is meaningful and representative of well thought-out definitions, that bias minimization has been considered, and that there is a clear purpose for the collection of new data.  

### Project Purpose 
As online news platforms increasingly rely on user data for personalization and advertising, it is important to understand how transparency and control over personal information impact user trust and willingness to share data. This research design aims to explore and test the role of data ethics, specifically focusing on areas such as informed consent, transparent data practices, and user expectations and values. 

This topic becomes increasingly important as users become more aware of how their data is being used and shared. Additionally, regulations like GDPR and CCPA are beginning to shape laws around how companies are allowed to utilize user data and how transparent they are required to be towards the user. 

### Files
Although no programming or data collection was performed, we applied social science research principles and frameworks to build the following deliverables:

- A research report outlining our research question, hypotheses, variables, sampling plan, data collection methods, and ethical considerations.

- A presentation deck summarizing our study design and rationale, emphasizing the significance of designing for ethical inquiry in digital environments.
