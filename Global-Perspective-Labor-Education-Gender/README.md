## An International Perspective on Primary Education, Gender, and the Labor Market

### Overview
This project explores global patterns in gender disparities across education and labor markets using data from the World Bankâ€™s Development Indicators. Specifically, it focuses on primary school enrollment rates for males and females, labor force participation by gender, and GDP per capita, offering a cross-national lens on how education and economic opportunity intersect across different regions.

Our goal was to answer the question: Is primary school enrollment linked to labor force participation and unemployment in low-, middle-, and high-income countries across genders? By examining the intersection of education and employment, this analysis provides insights into global development trends that could inform policymakers, international development organizations, and educational institutions.

### Methodology and Tools
Data was extracted from the World Bank. Ahead of the analysis, the data was filtered, missing values were handled, country names standardized, and, finally, the data was melted to facilitate comparisons of country indicators. All of this was completed in Python using Pandas and Numpy packages. 

We then conducted exploratory data analysis to visualize trends and investigate regional and income based differences, as well as identify structural patterns and outliers. We used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear and comprehensive data visualizations that communicated our overall findings.
