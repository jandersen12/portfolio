## Hypothesis Testing – Political Party Values

### Overview
This project investigates whether there are statistically significant differences in core political values between Democrats and Republicans across the 2024 election cycle regarding their views on primary and secondary education. Using survey data from the American National Elections Studies (ANES) and hypothesis testing, we assess these claims about polarization in political party values.

### Project Relevance

The political climate has remained deeply polarized over the past three election cycles, with Democrats and Republicans seemingly holding opposing stances on nearly every major issue. One such issue that has frequently been at the center of these conflicts is education. With constant exposure to media headlines, we are often inclined to wonder whether the average voters truly hold such opposing viewpoints, or if in fact the differences are not as extreme as they are presented. We will focus specifically on analyzing whether polarization is present in party views on schooling by answering: "Do Democratic and Republican voters have different views of primary and secondary schooling?"

### Skills and Tools

- R Libraries Used: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, conflicted, rcrossref, flextable, effsize, effectsize
- Hypothesis Testing – Formulating null/alternative hypotheses, conducting t-tests, and interpreting p-values and effect sizes.
- Quantitative Reasoning – Evaluating statistical significance and practical relevance using metrics like Cohen’s d.
- Data Wrangling – Cleaning and transforming raw survey data with tools like dplyr and tidyverse.
- Data Visualization – Creating meaningful graphs (e.g., histograms, boxplots) with ggplot2 to communicate insights clearly.
