##  Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases the skills I have learned and how I have been able to implement them in hands-on projects with data analysis, problem solving, research design and algorithm building. Each project represents a hands-on application of the concepts I've learned, demonstrating my ability to turn data into insights and build solutions to complex challenges.

###  Repository Structure

Each project has its own directory containing a README explaining its purpose, a final written report, source code, any necessary data, and the final presentation (if applicable).
