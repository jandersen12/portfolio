##  Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases the skills I have learned and how I have been able to implement them in hands-on projects with data analysis, problem solving, research design and algorithm building. Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that highlight my skills in data analysis, problem-solving, research design, and algorithm development. Each project represents a hands-on application of the concepts I've learned, demonstrating my ability to turn data into insights and build solutions to complex challenges.

###  Repository Structure

Each project has its own directory containing a README explaining its purpose, a final written report, source code, any necessary data, and the final presentation (if applicable).
