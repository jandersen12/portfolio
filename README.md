## Overview of Projects

**An International Perspective on Primary Education, Gender, and the Labor Market**
This project explores the relationship between primary school enrollment, labor force participation, and unemployment across low-, middle-, and high-income countries, with a focus on gender disparities. Using World Bank Development Indicators, we conducted data cleaning, transformation, and data analysis to examine how education levels are related to employment outcomes globally.
