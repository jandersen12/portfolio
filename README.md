##  Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases the skills I have learned and how I have been able to implement them in hands-on projects.

Recently published projects are focused on:
- Data cleaning and analysis in R and Python
- Research design
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Algorithm building

Projects I'm currently working on:
- Applying graph database algorithms in Neo4j using Python and SQL
- Exploratory linear regression  

###  Repository Structure

Each project has its own directory containing a README explaining its purpose, a final written report, source code, any necessary data, and the final presentation (if applicable).
